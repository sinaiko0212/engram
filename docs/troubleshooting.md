# Troubleshooting

Common setup and runtime issues, and how to resolve them. If something here doesn't cover your problem, ask on [Discord](https://discord.gg/G8fjjGswdc) or open an [issue](https://github.com/Jsakkos/engram/issues) — a [diagnostics bundle](#diagnostics-bundle) makes it much easier to help.

## FFmpeg not detected (Windows)

Engram needs FFmpeg for episode matching (it extracts and decodes the audio that speech recognition transcribes). If the Config Wizard's **Tools** step shows *"FFmpeg not found"* even though you installed it, it's almost always because FFmpeg isn't on your `PATH` — **not** because of the version. Engram doesn't care which FFmpeg version you have; it only needs to be able to run it.

Work through these in order:

**1. Confirm FFmpeg actually runs.** Open a **new** PowerShell or Command Prompt window and run:

```powershell
ffmpeg -version
```

- If you see version output, FFmpeg is on your `PATH` — skip to step 2.
- If you see *"'ffmpeg' is not recognized…"*, FFmpeg is installed but not on your `PATH`. Go to step 3.

**2. Restart Engram.** A running program keeps the `PATH` it was launched with. If you installed FFmpeg (or edited your `PATH`) while Engram was open, **fully close and reopen Engram** so it sees the change, then click **Re-scan** in the Config Wizard.

**3. Put FFmpeg where Engram can find it.** Pick whichever is easiest:

- **Install with winget** (recommended) and restart Engram:

  ```powershell
  winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
  ```

- **Add it to your PATH:** extract your FFmpeg download, then add the `...\bin` folder (the one containing `ffmpeg.exe`) to your system `PATH` via *Settings → Edit the system environment variables → Environment Variables*. Restart Engram afterward.

- **Drop it in a scanned location:** copy `ffmpeg.exe` to `C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe`. Engram scans this path (and the Chocolatey / scoop / winget install locations) automatically — no `PATH` change needed.

- **Point Engram at it directly:** in the Config Wizard (or **Settings → Tools**), click **Override path manually** and enter the **full path to `ffmpeg.exe`** — for example `C:\Users\You\Downloads\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe`. Enter the path to the **`.exe` file itself**, not the folder it lives in. The path is validated immediately and shows the detected version on success.

See [Installing FFmpeg](getting-started/installation.md#installing-ffmpeg) for download links.

### FFmpeg on Linux / macOS

Install it with your package manager (`sudo apt install ffmpeg`, `sudo dnf install ffmpeg`, or `brew install ffmpeg`). See the [Linux / macOS setup guide](guide/linux-setup.md#ffmpeg-not-found) for details.

## MakeMKV not detected

MakeMKV is required for disc ripping. If the Config Wizard can't find it, install it from [makemkv.com](https://www.makemkv.com/) and, if it still isn't detected, use **Override path manually** to point at `makemkvcon64.exe` (typically under `C:\Program Files (x86)\MakeMKV\`). On Linux, see [Linux / macOS setup](guide/linux-setup.md). Don't forget to enter your MakeMKV license key in the wizard.

## TMDB token not working

The TMDB field expects a **Read Access Token** (v4 auth) — the long string starting with `eyJ…` — not the shorter v3 "API Key". The wizard validates it as you type. See [Configuration](getting-started/configuration.md) for where to find it.

## Discord notifications aren't arriving

Engram posts to a Discord webhook when a disc completes, fails, or parks waiting for you.
Settings live under **Settings, Preferences, Notifications**.

**First, prove the webhook works.** Click **Send test message**. It tests the webhook you
have saved, so if you just pasted a new URL, save before testing. A sample notification
should appear in the channel within a second or two. If it doesn't:

- Read the message next to the button. A red cross means Discord refused the post, which
  usually means the webhook or its channel was deleted: re-create it under **Channel
  Settings, Integrations, Webhooks** and paste the fresh URL. An amber warning means the
  check itself could not run, so the webhook may well be fine and the problem is between
  your browser and Engram.
- Check that the URL starts with `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/`.

**The test works but real discs are silent.** Check the three per-event toggles. Each
event has its own switch, so it's possible to have completions enabled and review
notifications turned off, or the reverse.

**Notifications arrive but don't alert my phone.** Discord does not push notifications for
embed content. Set **Review Mention** to your user ID (`<@123456789012345678>`), a role
(`<@&987654321098765432>`), or `@here`. That value is sent as the message body, which is
the part Discord actually pings on. To find your user ID, enable **Developer Mode** in
Discord's Advanced settings, then right-click your name and choose **Copy User ID**.

**Notifications aren't clickable.** Set **Dashboard URL** to the address you use to reach
Engram from other devices, for example `http://192.168.1.50:5173`. Notifications then link
straight to the job. Leave it blank and notifications still arrive, just without a link.

**Every disc in my box set looks the same.** Each notification carries a **Disc** field
built from the disc's volume label plus its disc number, so `THE_WIRE_S1 (Disc 3)` is
distinct from disc 4. If the field shows only `Disc 1`, the disc reported no volume label
and Engram has no better identity to use; naming the disc during identification fixes it
for that job.

## Diagnostics bundle

When reporting a problem, attach a diagnostics bundle so the logs and environment come with it. From the dashboard, open a job's detail view and download its diagnostic `.zip`, or fetch the overall report from `GET /api/diagnostics/report`. Secrets (API keys, tokens) are redacted automatically.

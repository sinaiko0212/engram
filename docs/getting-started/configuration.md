# Configuration

## Config Wizard

On first launch, Engram presents a Config Wizard that walks you through essential setup:

- **MakeMKV path** -- auto-detected if on your system PATH
- **FFmpeg path** -- auto-detected if on your system PATH
- **Staging path** -- where ripped files are stored temporarily
- **Library paths** -- separate directories for Movies and TV shows
- **TMDB Read Access Token** -- for media metadata and poster art
- **MakeMKV license key** -- your MakeMKV registration key

Settings are stored in the SQLite database and can be edited at any time from the Settings page (gear icon in the dashboard header).

## TMDB API Token

The TMDB setting requires a **Read Access Token** (v4 auth), **not** the shorter v3 API Key.

To obtain your token:

1. Create an account at [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
2. Go to [API Settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
3. Copy the **Read Access Token** -- this is a long JWT string starting with `eyJ...`.

!!! warning "Common mistake"
    The v3 "API Key" is a short alphanumeric string. Engram needs the v4 "Read Access Token" (the long JWT). Using the wrong one will cause TMDB lookups to fail silently.

The configuration field is named `tmdb_api_key` for backwards compatibility, but it expects the v4 Read Access Token.

## Environment Variables

An optional `backend/.env` file can override server-level defaults. These settings are **not** managed through the Config Wizard -- they control the server itself.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLite connection string | `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./engram.db` |
| `HOST` | Server bind address | `127.0.0.1` |
| `PORT` | Server port | `8000` |
| `DEBUG` | Enable simulation endpoints | `false` |

Example `.env` file:

```ini
DEBUG=true
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000
```

!!! note
    The `.env` file is optional. All fields have sensible defaults. The file is included in `.gitignore` and should never be committed.

## LAN Access (Dashboard on Other Devices)

By default Engram binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only), so the dashboard is only reachable on the machine running Engram. To monitor from a phone, tablet, or another computer on the same network:

### Via Settings (Windows desktop)

1. Open the Settings page (gear icon) → **Preferences** step.
2. Enable **"Allow access from other devices on my network (LAN)"**.
3. The panel below the toggle shows your LAN address and a QR code once the change is applied.
4. Click **Save** and **restart Engram** — the bind address is fixed at startup.

!!! warning "No authentication"
    Engram has no login. Anyone on your network can view job status and control the application.
    Only enable this on a trusted home network.

After restart, access the dashboard from any device on your LAN at `http://<host-ip>:8000`.
The QR code makes it easy to open on a phone or tablet.

### Via environment variable (power users / Docker)

Set `HOST=0.0.0.0` in your `backend/.env` file (or pass it as an environment variable in Docker).
The env var takes precedence over the UI toggle:

```ini
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000
```

For Docker containers this is typically the right approach — the container has its own network
namespace, so binding to `127.0.0.1` inside the container would make it unreachable even via
published ports.

## Configuration Sources

Configuration is resolved in this priority order:

1. **Database** (`app_config` table) -- runtime configuration, editable via API and Config Wizard
2. **Environment variables** (or `.env` file) -- server-level settings only
3. **Defaults** -- hardcoded in the `AppConfig` model

## Configuration Fields

### Paths

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `staging_path` | Temporary directory for ripped files | *(set during wizard)* |
| `library_movies_path` | Movie library root directory | *(set during wizard)* |
| `library_tv_path` | TV show library root directory | *(set during wizard)* |
| `makemkv_path` | Path to `makemkvcon` executable | *(auto-detected)* |
| `ffmpeg_path` | Path to `ffmpeg` executable | *(auto-detected)* |

### API Keys

| Field | Description | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `makemkv_key` | MakeMKV registration key | Redacted in API responses |
| `tmdb_api_key` | TMDB Read Access Token (v4) | Redacted in API responses |

### Matching & Processing

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `max_concurrent_matches` | Parallel episode-matching (ASR) tasks | `2` |
| `matcher_min_confidence` | Minimum confidence to auto-accept an episode match | `0.6` |
| `enable_gpu_acceleration` | Run transcription on an NVIDIA GPU (opt-in; downloads the CUDA runtime) | `false` |
| `conflict_resolution_default` | File conflict handling | `"ask"` |

`max_concurrent_matches` is the main matching-throughput knob. It's clamped to your hardware and
takes effect on restart — see [Performance & Hardware](../guide/performance.md#concurrency-tuning)
for how to tune it for CPU vs GPU and bulk imports.

`enable_gpu_acceleration` is best toggled from **Settings → Matching → GPU Acceleration** rather than
edited directly, since enabling it triggers the one-time CUDA-runtime download. See
[GPU acceleration](../guide/performance.md#gpu-acceleration-faster-whisper-asr).

The `conflict_resolution_default` field accepts one of four values:

- `"ask"` -- prompt via the review queue (default)
- `"skip"` -- skip files that already exist in the library
- `"overwrite"` -- replace existing files
- `"rename"` -- keep both by writing a numbered `(vN)` variant

### AI-Powered Title Resolution

`ai_identification_enabled` (default: `false`) — when enabled, Engram sends the disc volume label and any collected metadata to your configured AI provider to help resolve ambiguous or unrecognised disc titles.

| Field | Description | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `ai_identification_enabled` | Enable AI-assisted disc title resolution | Requires `ai_provider`, plus `ai_api_key` for a hosted provider |
| `ai_provider` | AI provider to use | Hosted: `anthropic`, `openai`, `openrouter`, `gemini`. Local: `ollama`, `lmstudio` |
| `ai_api_key` | API key for the selected provider | Redacted in API responses. Not needed for a local provider |
| `ai_model` | Model override | Blank uses Engram's default for the provider. Set this when your key has no access to that default. **Required** for a local provider, which has no default |
| `ai_local_base_url` | Address of a local AI server | Local providers only. Blank uses the provider's conventional port |

See [Local AI](#local-ai-ollama-and-lm-studio) to run this against your own machine instead of a paid API.

### AI-Powered Episode Matching

`ai_episode_matching_enabled` (default: `false`) — when enabled, low-confidence TV episode matches are sent to your configured AI provider with the season's TMDB synopses for a suggested episode. Always surfaces through the [review queue](../guide/review-queue.md); never auto-organizes. Shares `ai_provider`/`ai_api_key` with [AI-Powered Title Resolution](#ai-powered-title-resolution).

See the [LLM Episode Matcher guide](../guide/llm-episode-matcher.md) for accuracy expectations and provider recommendations (Gemini Flash-Lite is best on this task).

### Local AI (Ollama and LM Studio)

Both AI features above can run against a model on your own machine instead of a
paid hosted API. Two servers are supported, and they work the same way because
they expose the same OpenAI-compatible interface.

**No API key is required.** The key field is hidden when a local provider is
selected.

#### Setup

1. Start your server:
    - **Ollama:** run `ollama serve`, then pull a model with `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`.
    - **LM Studio:** open the Developer tab, load a model, and start the server.
2. In Engram, open **Settings → Data sharing → AI assistance**, enable AI
   identification, and choose **Ollama (local)** or **LM Studio (local)**.
3. Leave **Server Address** blank to use the default:

    | Provider | Default address |
    |----------|-----------------|
    | Ollama | `http://localhost:11434/v1` |
    | LM Studio | `http://localhost:1234/v1` |

    Set it only if your server runs on another port, or on another machine on
    your network.
4. Pick a model from the **Model** dropdown. The list is read from your server,
   so it only populates once the server is running. Unlike the hosted providers
   there is no default model, because the answer depends on what you installed.
5. Click **Test Connection** to confirm Engram can reach it.

#### Choosing a model

Any instruction-tuned model in roughly the 7B-14B range works well. Both tasks
ask for a small JSON reply, so reasoning-heavy or very large models cost a lot
of time for little benefit.

The dropdown lists everything the server offers, including embedding models
(names containing `embed`). Those cannot answer chat requests; pick an
instruction-tuned model instead. Neither server's model list distinguishes the
two, so Engram cannot filter them for you.

#### Performance

Set **Max Concurrent Matches** to 1 in *Preferences → Matching*. A local server
has one GPU or CPU, so parallel requests queue rather than overlap, and several
large contexts at once can exhaust VRAM. Engram shows a reminder in Settings
when a local provider is selected with concurrency above 1; it does not override
your setting.

The first request after loading a model is slow. LM Studio loads weights on
demand, which can take 30-60 seconds before any text appears. Engram allows up
to five minutes for a local response, so this is expected rather than a failure.

#### Troubleshooting

| Message | Cause |
|---------|-------|
| `Could not reach Ollama at ...` | The server is not running, or the address is wrong |
| `'<model>' is not installed on this server` | The model is not pulled (Ollama) or not downloaded (LM Studio). The message lists what is available |
| `Select a model first` | Local providers have no default; pick one from the dropdown |

!!! note "Why Engram checks the model list before testing"
    LM Studio answers a request for an unknown model by silently serving
    whichever model is currently loaded, returning HTTP 200 with no warning. A
    typo would otherwise pass the connection test and then quietly matter at
    match time, so Engram verifies the model against the server's own list
    first.

### Extras Policy

Controls how bonus content (behind-the-scenes, deleted scenes, etc.) is handled during organization:

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `extras_policy` | How to handle extras (`"keep"`, `"skip"`, `"ask"`) | `"keep"` |

### Import Watch Folder

Engram can auto-ingest pre-ripped MKV files dropped into a watched folder. See the
[Import Watch Folder guide](../guide/import-watch-folder.md) for folder layouts and the full
workflow.

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `import_watch_path` | Folder to watch for incoming MKV files (unset = disabled) | *(none)* |
| `import_destination_mode` | `"library"` files imports into your Movies/TV libraries; `"in_place"` organizes them inside the watch folder | `"library"` |
| `staging_watch_enabled` | Also auto-import folders dropped into the staging directory | `false` |

### Staging Cleanup

Controls when the staging directory is reclaimed after a job finishes. Watch-folder imports are
never deleted regardless of this setting (the source folder is yours). See
[sizing the staging directory](../guide/performance.md#sizing-the-staging-directory).

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `staging_cleanup_policy` | `"on_success"`, `"on_completion"`, `"manual"`, or `"after_days"` | `"on_success"` |
| `staging_cleanup_days` | Retention period when policy is `"after_days"` | `7` |

### Drive Behavior

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `auto_eject_enabled` | Eject the disc automatically when ripping finishes | `true` |

Disable `auto_eject_enabled` if you want to keep the disc in the drive after ripping — for example, to manually verify the output or to re-rip a title without re-inserting the disc. Applies to both normal rips and re-rips triggered from the review queue.

### Disc Backup

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `backup_before_rip` | Copy the whole disc to a separate folder first, then extract from that copy | `false` |
| `backup_path` | Where those copies go | (empty) |

With this on, Engram writes a full decrypted MakeMKV copy of each disc under
`backup_path` after identifying it, then extracts your MKVs from that copy
instead of from the drive. Three things change:

- **The disc is read once, sequentially**, instead of once per title. That is
  much gentler on a scratched or fragile disc.
- **The disc comes out of the drive as soon as the copy finishes**, not when the
  whole rip finishes, so you can swap discs sooner.
- **You keep the copy.** Engram never deletes a completed backup. It is yours to
  move to a preservation server or re-import later.

The cost is time and space: a Blu-ray backup is typically 25 to 50 GB and adds a
full pass over the disc before extraction starts.

Backups mirror your library layout, so the shelf browses the way your library
does:

```
backups/
  Movies/
    Inception (2010)/
  TV/
    Frasier/
      Season 01/
        S01D01/
  Unidentified/
    THE_SWEETEST_THING/
```

The folder names come from your own naming settings, so if you customise
`naming_movie_format` or `naming_tv_show_format` the backups follow.

If anything prevents a backup (no folder configured, not enough free space, a
disc MakeMKV cannot address, or a copy that fails partway) **Engram rips
directly from the drive instead and tells you why on the job card.** Turning
this on cannot make a disc less likely to finish.

You can also point the **Import** button at a backup you already have. A folder
containing `BDMV` or `VIDEO_TS`, or an `.iso` file, is recognised as a disc
image and run through the normal scan, identify, rip, match and organize
pipeline. Point it at a whole shelf of backups and it queues one job per disc.

### Naming Conventions

Out of the box, organized files follow these patterns:

- **Movies**: `Movies/Name (Year)/Name (Year).mkv`
- **TV Shows**: `TV/Show/Season XX/Show - SXXEXX.mkv`

Both patterns are configurable under **Settings → Preferences → Naming & extras**. (The season
and episode formats appear once you set Naming Convention to Custom.) Formats are Python format
strings, and any placeholder that turns out to be empty takes its surrounding group with it, so
a movie with no known year is filed as `Blade Runner`, never `Blade Runner ()`.

#### Movie naming

| Setting | Default | Placeholders |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Movie Folder Format | `{title} ({year})` | `{title}`, `{year}`, `{tmdb_id}` |
| Movie Filename Format | blank | `{title}`, `{year}`, `{tmdb_id}`, `{edition}` |

Leaving the filename format blank means "reuse the folder format", so customizing the folder
carries through to the file and the two cannot drift apart:

```
Folder format "{title} - {year}", filename blank
  -> Movies/Blade Runner - 1982/Blade Runner - 1982.mkv
```

When a movie has an edition (chosen in the review queue), Engram appends the Plex
`{edition-...}` tag to the inherited filename, because Plex reads the edition off the file
rather than the folder:

```
Movies/Blade Runner (1982)/Blade Runner (1982) {edition-Final Cut}.mkv
```

Setting an explicit filename format takes full control and turns off both the inheritance and
the automatic edition tag.

#### TV naming

| Setting | Default | Placeholders |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Show Folder Format | `{show}` | `{show}`, `{year}`, `{tmdb_id}` |
| Season Folder Format | `Season {season:02d}` | `{season}` |
| Episode Filename Format | `{show} - S{season:02d}E{episode:02d}` | `{show}`, `{season}`, `{episode}`, `{year}`, `{tmdb_id}` |

#### Letting same-name titles coexist

Two different shows or movies can share a name (Frasier 1993 and Frasier 2023). Adding the id
tag your media server expects keeps them in separate folders and stops the server from merging
them:

- **Plex**: `{title} ({year}) {{tmdb-{tmdb_id}}}` (or `{show} ...` for TV)
- **Jellyfin**: `{title} ({year}) [tmdbid-{tmdb_id}]`

The doubled braces in the Plex form are how a literal `{` is written in a format string.

## Configuration Flow

```
User edits config in Config Wizard / Settings page
  |
  v
PUT /api/config
  |
  v
Update AppConfig in database
  |
  v
JobManager reloads config on next operation
  |
  v
Components use updated settings
```

## Validation

Configuration is validated at multiple levels:

- **Pydantic models** -- type checking and required fields
- **API routes** -- path existence checks, MakeMKV license validation
- **Validation endpoints** -- `POST /api/validate/makemkv`, `POST /api/validate/ffmpeg`, `GET /api/detect-tools`
- **JobManager** -- pre-flight checks before starting any job

API keys are **redacted** (masked as `"***"`) in `GET /api/config` responses. The `PUT /api/config` endpoint accepts new values but never returns sensitive fields in the response.

# Conjoined Multi-Episode Tracks Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Stop filing conjoined multi-segment cartoon episodes (e.g. The Weekenders, Courage the Cowardly Dog: two 11-minute segments in one 23-minute DVD track) as Extras, and instead route them to human review with both episode codes identified.

**Architecture:** Demote the duration pre-filter from a terminal verdict to an *admission test*, and let the ASR chunk votes make the real call. The matcher already records the video timestamp of every chunk vote (`MatchCoverage.matched_chunks`), so "how many episodes are in this file" becomes an observation over positional vote runs rather than duration arithmetic. Duration only decides whether a track is worth transcribing; the run decomposition decides what it contains.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.11+, pytest, SQLModel/async SQLAlchemy, faster-whisper + TF-IDF matcher. Backend only, no frontend changes.

---

## Background: why duration alone cannot decide this

The failing gate is `_duration_matches_episode_runtime` in
`backend/app/services/matching_coordinator.py:54`. TMDB catalogues each 11-minute
cartoon *segment* as its own episode, so the season runtimes come back as
`[11] * 16`. The physical DVD track is a 23-minute broadcast half-hour holding two
segments. The accept window is `[rt - 5, rt + 10]` = `[6, 21]`, and 23 fails it for
every entry. `_handle_extras` then early-returns before the file is ever transcribed.

Widening the window is not a fix. A conjoined 3-episode track and a 3-episode
"Play All" are physically identical, so no duration rule can separate them.

Two facts constrain the design:

1. **Play All is already handled elsewhere, and is disc-scoped.** `Analyst._detect_play_all`
   (`backend/app/core/analyst.py:848`) requires a title to be at least
   `analyst_movie_min_duration` (**80 minutes**) *and* within +/-20% of the sum of the
   entire episode cluster. Those titles are deselected before ripping
   (`backend/app/services/identification_coordinator.py:462`), so they never reach
   `_match_single_title`. The duration pre-filter's real job is catching *extras*
   (featurettes), not Play Alls.
2. **Positional vote data already exists.** `MatchCoverage.add_match(start_time, chunk_len, score)`
   (`backend/app/matcher/episode_identification.py:886`) stores the video timestamp of
   every vote, per episode. And `select_chunk_vote` requires the top episode to lead the
   runner-up by `CHUNK_VOTE_MARGIN_RATIO = 1.8` or it **abstains**, so a 30-second chunk
   straddling the seam between two segments transcribes half of each and abstains. The
   seam marks itself.

The resulting signal, over the default 10 scan points:

| Track | Vote sequence (sorted by timestamp) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Single episode | `E01 E01 E01 E01 E01 E01 E01 E01 E01 E01` | 1 run, single |
| Conjoined E01+E02 | `E01 E01 E01 E01 (abstain) E02 E02 E02 E02 E02` | 2 contiguous runs, multi |
| Single ep + ASR noise | `E01 E01 E07 E01 E01 E13 E01 E01 E01 E01` | singletons dropped, single |
| Episode + 12min featurette | `E01 E01 E01 E01 (abstain x6)` | 1 run, sparse coverage |

**Where N stops.** N is bounded by evidence density, not by a magic number, and the
bound is enforced rather than assumed. With `N` evenly spaced scan points split into `R`
runs, an edge run of `k` votes owns `(k - 0.5)/(N - 1)` of the timeline, so the territory
rule can only reject the smallest admissible run when `N > 3R + 1`. Below that it cannot
discriminate at all, so the module refuses the verdict (`insufficient_scan_depth`) instead
of guessing. At the default 10 scan points a confident verdict therefore caps at **two**
episodes; three needs the next lattice level (19).

Note the two caps differ on purpose. The duration admission (Task 1) is permissive at
`MAX_CONJOINED_EPISODES = 3` because its only job is deciding what is worth transcribing;
the vote verdict is stricter because its job is deciding what to claim. Both sit far below
the 80-minute Play All floor, and Play All titles are deselected before ripping anyway.

## Scope

**In scope (this plan):** Tasks 1-4. Conjoined tracks reach ASR, are identified as
multi-episode, and land in REVIEW with both codes as a suggestion.

**Explicitly deferred (separate plan):** multi-episode *naming and organizing*
(`Show - S01E01-E02`), which additionally requires auditing anchored episode-code
regexes at `backend/app/core/discord_notifier.py:196` and
`backend/app/services/disc_contribution_queue.py:42`, both of which silently discard
a compound code today.

**Why Tasks 1-2 cannot ship without Tasks 3-4:** if the gate stops filing conjoined
tracks as extras but nothing consumes the verdict, ASR picks whichever of the two
episodes scores marginally higher and returns it with high confidence. That is a
silent mislabel where E02 vanishes from the library, strictly worse than today's
recoverable "extra". Task 3 is the safety seam; do not merge Tasks 1-2 alone.

## File Structure

- **Create** `backend/app/matcher/multi_episode.py`: pure run-decomposition logic.
  No imports from `app.services` or `app.models`; depends only on stdlib. This keeps it
  unit-testable with synthetic vote lists (no MKV, no audio, no Whisper) and importable
  from both the matcher and the services layer.
- **Create** `backend/tests/unit/test_multi_episode.py`: tests for the above.
- **Modify** `backend/app/services/matching_coordinator.py`: add the conjoined-duration
  admission test (Task 1); make the pre-filter non-terminal and route confirmed
  multi-episode matches to REVIEW (Task 3).
- **Modify** `backend/app/matcher/episode_identification.py`: build the vote list from
  the existing `coverages` and attach the verdict to `match_details` (Task 3).
- **Modify** `backend/app/services/finalization_coordinator.py:223`: register the new
  REVIEW error code as non-rematchable (Task 4).
- **Modify** `backend/tests/unit/test_matching_coordinator.py`: tests for Task 1.

`backend/app/core/curator.py` needs **no changes**: `match_details` already flows
verbatim from `identify_episode` through `MatchResult` to `DiscTitle.match_details`.

---

### Task 1: Conjoined-duration admission test

A pure predicate answering "could this track plausibly be N consecutive episodes?".
It is a *hint* only; Task 2's run decomposition is authoritative. Note the windows for
adjacent N can overlap (for 11-minute runtimes, N=2 gives `[17, 32]` and N=3 gives
`[28, 43]`); returning the smallest N is fine precisely because the votes decide the
real count.

**Files:**
- Modify: `backend/app/services/matching_coordinator.py` (after line 65, below `_duration_matches_episode_runtime`)
- Test: `backend/tests/unit/test_matching_coordinator.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Append to `backend/tests/unit/test_matching_coordinator.py`. Note `GILMORE_S1` is already
defined at line 137 of that file; reuse it, do not redefine it.

### Task 2: Positional vote-run decomposition

The load-bearing piece. Pure function over a list of `(timestamp, episode_code)` votes,
so it tests with no audio, no MKV, and no Whisper.

Four checks turn runs into a verdict:

1. **Minimum run weight**: a code needs at least 2 votes (mirrors the matcher's existing
   `min_vote_count=2`). Drops ASR noise singletons.
2. **Contiguity**: each surviving code's votes must form one solid positional block.
   Interleaved codes are noise, not a second episode.
3. **Coverage**: the runs must jointly account for most of the scan points. This is what
   separates "two conjoined episodes" from "one episode plus a bonus featurette", which
   duration arithmetic cannot do at all.
4. **Territory**: each run must OWN a fair share of the timeline. A recap that wins two
   votes in the first 90 seconds occupies a sliver of the file; a real segment owns
   roughly 1/N of it. This check uses run POSITION, not vote count, because by vote
   count a 2-vote recap and a 2-vote genuine segment are indistinguishable.

**Files:**
- Create: `backend/app/matcher/multi_episode.py`
- Test: `backend/tests/unit/test_multi_episode.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Create `backend/tests/unit/test_multi_episode.py`:

cd backend && uv run pytest tests/unit/test_multi_episode.py -v
```

Expected: collection error, `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.matcher.multi_episode'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the implementation**

Create `backend/app/matcher/multi_episode.py`:

```python
"""Detect a physical track that concatenates several TMDB episodes.

Cartoon and anthology discs put two or three ~11-minute segments in one DVD title,
while TMDB catalogues each segment as its own episode. Such a track matches no
single TMDB runtime, and the duration pre-filter used to file it as an extra
without ever transcribing it (issue #622).

Duration cannot solve this: a conjoined 3-episode track and a 3-episode "Play All"
are physically identical. The POSITION of each chunk vote can. ``identify_episode``
already records the video timestamp of every vote (``MatchCoverage.add_match``), and
``select_chunk_vote`` abstains when the top two episodes score similarly, so the
chunk straddling the seam between two segments casts no vote and the seam marks
itself. Conjoined episodes therefore appear as contiguous, balanced runs along the
timeline; ASR confusion appears as interleaved singletons.

Pure stdlib by design (no app.models, no app.services): the whole decision is
testable with synthetic vote lists, no MKV or Whisper required.

Known limitation: the span is measured between the first and last VOTE, not across
the scanned range, so a file with a large unexplained head or tail (e.g. a third
segment absent from the TMDB reference set) can still yield a confident two-episode
verdict. Closing it needs the scan offsets, not just their count. Accepted for now
because a positive verdict routes the track to REVIEW rather than naming it, so the
cost is an incomplete suggestion a human corrects, not a wrong filename on disk.

### Task 3: Wire the verdict through matching

Three edits: the matcher publishes the verdict, the pre-filter stops being terminal,
and any track that is or might be multi-episode goes to REVIEW instead of being
auto-organized under one of its codes.

**Note the two functions.** The duration pre-filter lives in `_run_match_single_file`
(starts line 697) but the MATCHED handling lives in `_match_single_file_inner` (starts
line 1078). They are DIFFERENT functions: `_run_match_single_file` calls the inner one
at line 889. A local variable will not carry between them, so the conjoined hint is
passed as a new parameter.

**Files:**
- Modify: `backend/app/matcher/episode_identification.py:1911-1916` (the `match_stats` dict)
- Modify: `backend/app/services/matching_coordinator.py:831-849` (the pre-filter branch)
- Modify: `backend/app/services/matching_coordinator.py:889` and `:1078-1086` (pass the hint)
- Modify: `backend/app/services/matching_coordinator.py:1472` (post-match routing)
- Test: `backend/tests/unit/test_matching_coordinator.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Publish the verdict from the matcher**

In `backend/app/matcher/episode_identification.py`, add the import next to the other
matcher imports at the top of the file:

```python
from app.matcher.multi_episode import decompose_vote_runs
```

Then replace lines 1911-1916 (beginning `# Prepare detailed stats for return`) with:

```python
            # Prepare detailed stats for return
            # Positional vote runs: a track holding two conjoined ~11-minute
            # segments votes for E01 across the first half and E02 across the
            # second, with the seam chunk abstaining. coverages already carries
            # every vote's timestamp, so this costs no extra transcription.
            # extract_season_episode returns (None, None) for a reference name it
            # cannot parse, so filter before formatting: an unguarded
            # "S{:02d}".format(None) raises ValueError and would abort the match.
            positional_votes: list[tuple[float, str]] = []
            for cov in coverages.values():
                cov_season, cov_episode = extract_season_episode(cov.episode_name)
                if cov_season is None or cov_episode is None:
                    continue
                cov_code = f"S{cov_season:02d}E{cov_episode:02d}"
                positional_votes.extend((c["start"], cov_code) for c in cov.matched_chunks)

            multi_verdict = decompose_vote_runs(positional_votes, len(scan_points))
            multi_detail = multi_verdict.to_dict()

            # decompose_vote_runs normalizes against the VOTED span, so a stretch
            # of the file that never voted is invisible to it (a third segment
            # missing from the TMDB reference set, say). Record the unexplained
            # head and tail here, where the scan offsets are in scope, so a
            # reviewer looking at a two-code suggestion for a three-segment file
            # has a signal that something is unaccounted for. Under-listing is
            # otherwise silent: a short code list looks complete.
            if positional_votes and scan_points:
                multi_detail["head_gap_seconds"] = round(
                    min(v[0] for v in positional_votes) - scan_points[0], 1
                )
                multi_detail["tail_gap_seconds"] = round(
                    scan_points[-1] - max(v[0] for v in positional_votes), 1
                )

            if multi_verdict.is_multi_episode:
                logger.info(
                    f"[Matcher] {video_file}: chunk votes describe "
                    f"{len(multi_verdict.runs)} conjoined episodes "
                    f"{multi_verdict.codes}, routing to review"
                )

            match_stats = {
                "matches_found": matches_found_count,
                "matches_rejected": matches_rejected_count,
                "total_chunks": len(scan_points),
                "multi_episode": multi_detail,
            }
```

`extract_season_episode` is already imported and used in this file (see line 1852).
No change is needed in `backend/app/core/curator.py`: `match_stats` is merged into
`best_match["match_details"]`, which flows verbatim into `DiscTitle.match_details`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Make the duration pre-filter non-terminal**

In `backend/app/services/matching_coordinator.py`, inside `_run_match_single_file`,
initialize the hint BEFORE the `try:` that opens the duration pre-filter (the `try:`
just after the `# 4. Duration pre-filter` comment block, around line 812), so it is in
scope after the `except`:

```python
        conjoined_hint: int | None = None
```

Then replace lines 831-849 (the `if runtimes and title_duration:` branch) with:

```python
                if runtimes and title_duration:
                    title_minutes = title_duration / 60
                    if not _duration_matches_episode_runtime(title_minutes, runtimes):
                        # Before filing this as an extra, check whether it looks
                        # like several conjoined episodes (cartoon segment discs).
                        # If so it is ADMITTED to matching, not filed: the
                        # positional vote runs decide what it actually holds.
                        conjoined_hint = _conjoined_episode_count(title_minutes, runtimes)
                        if conjoined_hint:
                            logger.info(
                                f"[MATCH] Title {title_id} (Job {job_id}): duration "

                        else:
                            # Re-fetch under a fresh session: _handle_extras writes.

                                        return
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Pass the hint into the inner function**

Still in `backend/app/services/matching_coordinator.py`, change the call at line 889 from:

```python
            await self._match_single_file_inner(
                job_id, title_id, file_path, num_points, min_vote_count, advisory=advisory

                job_id,
                title_id,
                file_path,
                num_points,
                min_vote_count,
                advisory=advisory,
                conjoined_hint=conjoined_hint,
            )
```

And add the parameter to `_match_single_file_inner`'s signature (line 1078-1086),
keeping the existing docstring and appending the new paragraph to it:

```python
    async def _match_single_file_inner(
        self,
        job_id: int,
        title_id: int,
        file_path: Path,
        num_points: int | None = None,
        min_vote_count: int | None = None,
        advisory: bool = False,
        conjoined_hint: int | None = None,
    ) -> None:
```

Append this paragraph to that method's existing docstring:

```
        ``conjoined_hint`` is the episode count the duration pre-filter admitted this
        track on (see ``_conjoined_episode_count``), or None for an ordinary track. A
        hinted track is parked for review even when the vote runs cannot confirm it,
        because ASR still returns one confident episode and naming the file after it
        would silently drop the rest.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Route multi-episode tracks to REVIEW**

Add the error-code constant next to `RIP_FAILURE_ERROR_CODES` (line 197 area):

```python
# A track that is, or might be, several conjoined episodes. Parked for a human
# because Engram cannot yet NAME a multi-episode file (S01E01-E02 organizing is a
# separate change): auto-organizing it under one of its codes would silently lose
# the others.
MULTI_EPISODE_ERROR_CODE = "multi_episode_detected"
```

Then, in `_match_single_file_inner`, immediately BEFORE the existing line
`if title.state == TitleState.MATCHED and title.match_source != "engram_chromaprint":`
(line 1472), insert:

```python
                # A track the chunk votes show is several conjoined episodes must
                # not be auto-organized under a single code: the other episodes
                # would vanish from the library. The same applies to a track the
                # DURATION admitted as conjoined whose votes could NOT confirm it
                # (too few scan points for the run count, sparse coverage) -- ASR
                # still returns one confident episode, so the silent-drop risk is
                # identical. Park both for a human; only the message differs.
                multi_detail = {}
                if title.match_details:
                    try:
                        multi_detail = (
                            json.loads(title.match_details) or {}
                        ).get("multi_episode") or {}
                    except (json.JSONDecodeError, TypeError):
                        multi_detail = {}
                confirmed_multi = bool(multi_detail.get("is_multi_episode"))
                if confirmed_multi or conjoined_hint:
                    details = json.loads(title.match_details) if title.match_details else {}
                    codes = multi_detail.get("codes") or []
                    title.state = TitleState.REVIEW
                    details["error"] = MULTI_EPISODE_ERROR_CODE
                    if confirmed_multi:
                        details["message"] = (
                            f"This track appears to contain {len(codes)} episodes "
                            f"({', '.join(codes)}). Engram cannot name a combined file "
                            "yet. Assign one episode, or mark it as an Extra."
                        )
                    else:
                        details["message"] = (
                            f"This track's runtime suggests about {conjoined_hint} "
                            "episodes joined together, but the audio match could not "
                            f"confirm it ({multi_detail.get('reason', 'no verdict')}). "
                            "Check it before assigning an episode."
                        )
                    title.match_details = json.dumps(details)
                    logger.info(
                        f"[MATCH] Title {title_id} (Job {job_id}): routed to review as "
                        f"multi-episode (confirmed={confirmed_multi}, "
                        f"hint={conjoined_hint}, codes={codes})"
                    )
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Write the tests**

Append to `backend/tests/unit/test_matching_coordinator.py`:

```python

            state=TitleState.MATCHED,
            match_details=json.dumps(details) if details is not None else None,
            match_source="engram",
        )

    def test_confirmed_multi_episode_goes_to_review(self):

        assert parsed["error"] == MULTI_EPISODE_ERROR_CODE
        assert "S01E01, S01E02" in parsed["message"]

    def test_admitted_but_unconfirmed_goes_to_review(self):

        details = {
            "multi_episode": {
                "is_multi_episode": False,
                "reason": "insufficient_scan_depth",

        )

        assert title.state == TitleState.MATCHED
```

For those tests to run, the routing logic in Step 4 must be extracted into a
module-level helper rather than being inlined, so it is testable without a DB. Define
it next to `MULTI_EPISODE_ERROR_CODE`:

```python
def _apply_multi_episode_review(title, conjoined_hint: int | None) -> bool:
    """Park a conjoined (or possibly-conjoined) track in REVIEW. Returns True if it did.

    A track the chunk votes show is several conjoined episodes must not be
    auto-organized under a single code: the other episodes would vanish from the
    library. The same applies to a track the DURATION admitted as conjoined whose
    votes could NOT confirm it (too few scan points for the run count, sparse
    coverage) -- ASR still returns one confident episode, so the silent-drop risk is
    identical. Only the reviewer-facing message differs.
    """
    multi_detail = {}
    if title.match_details:
        try:
            multi_detail = (json.loads(title.match_details) or {}).get("multi_episode") or {}
        except (json.JSONDecodeError, TypeError):
            multi_detail = {}
    confirmed_multi = bool(multi_detail.get("is_multi_episode"))
    if not (confirmed_multi or conjoined_hint):
        return False

    try:
        details = json.loads(title.match_details) if title.match_details else {}
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, TypeError):
        details = {}
    codes = multi_detail.get("codes") or []
    title.state = TitleState.REVIEW
    details["error"] = MULTI_EPISODE_ERROR_CODE
    if confirmed_multi:
        details["message"] = (
            f"This track appears to contain {len(codes)} episodes "
            f"({', '.join(codes)}). Engram cannot name a combined file yet. "
            "Assign one episode, or mark it as an Extra."
        )
    else:
        details["message"] = (
            f"This track's runtime suggests about {conjoined_hint} episodes joined "
            "together, but the audio match could not confirm it "
            f"({multi_detail.get('reason', 'no verdict')}). "
            "Check it before assigning an episode."
        )
    title.match_details = json.dumps(details)
    return True
```

Then Step 4's inlined block becomes just:

```python
                if _apply_multi_episode_review(title, conjoined_hint):
                    logger.info(
                        f"[MATCH] Title {title_id} (Job {job_id}): routed to review "
                        f"as multi-episode (hint={conjoined_hint})"
                    )
```

Add `_apply_multi_episode_review` to the test file's existing import block from
`app.services.matching_coordinator`, and make sure `SimpleNamespace` and `json` are
imported in that test file (both already are, at lines 9 and 11).

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the matching and matcher unit tests**

```bash
cd backend && uv run pytest tests/unit/test_matching_coordinator.py tests/unit/test_multi_episode.py tests/unit/test_episode_identification.py tests/unit/test_chunk_vote_gate.py tests/unit/test_curator.py -v
```

Expected: PASS. Watch specifically that `test_play_all_track_is_an_extra` and
`test_short_featurette_is_an_extra` stay green: they are the invariants this task
could plausibly break.

Then lint:

```bash
cd backend && uv run ruff check app tests && uv run ruff format --check app tests
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add backend/app/matcher/episode_identification.py backend/app/services/matching_coordinator.py backend/tests/unit/test_matching_coordinator.py
git commit -m "feat(matching): admit conjoined tracks to ASR and park them for review (#622)"
```

**Deferred, deliberately:** `insufficient_scan_depth` semantically means "retry
deeper" rather than "no", and the machinery exists (`identify_episode` takes
`num_points` on the 10/19/37/73/145 lattice, already used by the deep re-match path).
This task does NOT escalate. The consequence is that a genuine THREE-segment track is
never confirmed at the default depth; it is parked for review via the
`conjoined_hint` path instead, which is safe but not automatic. The reported bug
(#622) is the two-segment case, which is fully handled at depth 10. Escalation
belongs with the multi-episode naming work.

### Task 4: Register the review code as non-rematchable

Without this, auto-escalation re-runs the matcher on the parked title and overwrites
`match_details`, destroying the multi-episode message the user needs to see.

**Files:**
- Modify: `backend/app/services/finalization_coordinator.py:223`
- Test: `backend/tests/unit/test_auto_review_escalation.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `backend/tests/unit/test_auto_review_escalation.py`:

```python
@pytest.mark.unit
def test_multi_episode_review_is_not_rematchable():
    """A track parked because it holds several conjoined episodes must not be
    re-matched: a denser ASR pass cannot change what the file contains, and the
    rerun overwrites the match_details message the reviewer needs (#622).
    """
    from app.services.finalization_coordinator import _is_rematchable_review

    title = SimpleNamespace(
        state=TitleState.REVIEW,
        is_extra=False,
        match_details=json.dumps(
            {
                "error": "multi_episode_detected",
                "multi_episode": {"is_multi_episode": True, "codes": ["S01E01", "S01E02"]},
            }
        ),
    )
    assert _is_rematchable_review(title) is False
```

If `SimpleNamespace`, `json`, or `TitleState` are not already imported in that file,
add them:

```python
import json
from types import SimpleNamespace

from app.models.disc_job import TitleState
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

```bash
cd backend && uv run pytest tests/unit/test_auto_review_escalation.py -k multi_episode -v
```

Expected: FAIL, `assert True is False`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the implementation**

In `backend/app/services/finalization_coordinator.py`, change line 223 from:

```python
_NON_REMATCHABLE_REVIEW_ERRORS = {"file_exists", "subtitle_download_failed"} | set(
    RIP_FAILURE_ERROR_CODES
)
```

to:

```python
_NON_REMATCHABLE_REVIEW_ERRORS = {
    "file_exists",
    "subtitle_download_failed",
    # A conjoined multi-episode track: re-matching cannot change what the file
    # holds, and the rerun would overwrite the reviewer-facing message (#622).
    MULTI_EPISODE_ERROR_CODE,
} | set(RIP_FAILURE_ERROR_CODES)
```

`MULTI_EPISODE_ERROR_CODE` comes from the same module as `RIP_FAILURE_ERROR_CODES`;
extend the existing import of `RIP_FAILURE_ERROR_CODES` in this file to include it.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

```bash
cd backend && uv run pytest tests/unit/test_auto_review_escalation.py -v
```

Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add backend/app/services/finalization_coordinator.py backend/tests/unit/test_auto_review_escalation.py
git commit -m "fix(review): keep conjoined-episode reviews out of auto-rematch (#622)"
```

---

### Task 5: Full-suite verification and changelog

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the backend unit tier**

```bash
cd backend && uv run pytest tests/unit/ -q
```

Expected: all pass. Note from prior sessions: `-p no:logging` speeds this tier up but
breaks roughly ten `caplog` tests, so do not add it here.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the pipeline tier**

```bash
cd backend && uv run pytest tests/pipeline/ -q
```

Expected: all pass. `tests/pipeline/test_play_all_detection.py` is the one to watch,
it covers the disc-scoped Play All path this plan deliberately does not touch.

If it errors with `no such table`, the worktree's `engram.db` is a 0-byte stub; run
`uv run python -c "import asyncio; from app.database import init_db; asyncio.run(init_db())"`
first.

- [ ] **Step 3: Lint and format**

```bash
cd backend && uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the changelog entry**

Add under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`, in a `### Fixed` subsection:

```markdown
- Cartoon and anthology discs that pack two or three short segments into one track
  (The Weekenders, Courage the Cowardly Dog) are no longer silently filed as Extras.
  Engram now recognizes a conjoined track from the position of its speech matches and
  parks it for review with the episodes it contains listed. (#622)
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "docs: changelog for conjoined multi-episode detection (#622)"
```

---

## Manual verification

Automated tests cover the decision logic but not the ASR path end to end. Before
opening the PR, confirm against a real conjoined disc (the reporter's case is
The Weekenders Volume 1) with exactly one backend running:

1. Rip or re-match one 23-minute track.
2. Grep the log for `fits ~2 conjoined episodes`: the admission fired.
3. Grep for `chunk votes describe 2 conjoined episodes`: the runs confirmed it.
4. Confirm the track lands in REVIEW naming both codes, and is **not** in Extras.
5. Confirm a genuine featurette on the same disc still lands in Extras.

Stop the backend and any `makemkvcon` children before opening the PR.

## Follow-on work (not this plan)

- **Multi-episode naming and organizing.** `Show - S01E01-E02` output, plus the anchored
  episode-code regexes at `backend/app/core/discord_notifier.py:196` and
  `backend/app/services/disc_contribution_queue.py:42`, which silently discard a
  compound code today. Until this lands, conjoined tracks stop at REVIEW by design.
- **`analyst_tv_min_duration` is 18 minutes** (`backend/app/models/app_config.py:91`).
  A disc exposing *individual* 11-minute segments falls below the TV range and never
  forms an episode cluster at all. Same family of bug, different layer; worth its own
  issue.

## Features

- **Automatic disc detection** — monitors optical drives and starts processing on insertion
- **Smart classification** — distinguishes TV shows from movies using duration analysis, TMDB lookup, and TheDiscDB; uses the MakeMKV disc name as a TMDB fallback for merged-word volume labels (e.g. `STRANGENEWWORLDS_SEASON3`)
- **Episode matching** — identifies TV episodes by transcribing the audio and matching it against reference subtitles
- **Acoustic fingerprint network** — a shared catalog of chromaprint audio fingerprints that identifies episodes without needing subtitles for the show. No audio or video leaves your machine; see [Contributing Data](docs/guide/contributing-data.md)
- **LLM episode matching (opt-in)** — when audio matching is uncertain, send the transcript + TMDB synopses to your configured AI provider for a suggested episode (Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI, or OpenRouter). Always confirmed via the review queue.
- **Subtitle downloads** — fetches subtitles via the OpenSubtitles.com REST API (preferred, free tier available) with Addic7ed as fallback
- **Real-time dashboard** — web UI with WebSocket live updates, progress tracking, and notifications
- **Human-in-the-loop** — review queue for low-confidence matches, unreadable disc labels, and ambiguous content with a pre-filled correction modal
- **Job history & analytics** — searchable archive of all completed/failed jobs with drill-down detail panel, processing timeline, and TheDiscDB metadata
- **TheDiscDB integration** — automatic disc identification via content-hash disc lookup with persisted title mappings
- **Contribute back** — share disc layouts with [TheDiscDB](https://thediscdb.com) so others can identify the same pressings automatically. Opt in under Settings → TheDiscDB Contributions
- **Responsive design** — works on desktop and mobile with compact/expanded view modes

## Platform support

| Feature | Windows | Linux | macOS |
|---------|---------|-------|-------|
| Automatic drive detection | Yes | Yes | No |
| Staging folder auto-import | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| MakeMKV ripping | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Episode matching (ASR) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Web dashboard & API | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Tool auto-detection | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| TheDiscDB / TMDB lookup | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Windows** has full automatic disc detection via kernel32 APIs. **Linux** has native optical-drive detection via `/sys/block` and `blkid`. On **macOS**, the backend and dashboard run fully, but disc insertion must be triggered via the staging import API.

On all platforms, Engram supports a **staging folder workflow**: drop a folder of pre-ripped MKV files into the staging directory and Engram will auto-detect, classify, match, and organize them. This is the primary workflow on systems without optical drives. See [Linux / macOS setup](docs/guide/linux-setup.md) for details.

## Prerequisites

- [MakeMKV](https://www.makemkv.com/) with a valid license
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for episode matching (audio extraction and transcription). Engram auto-detects it on your `PATH` — see [installing FFmpeg](docs/getting-started/installation.md#installing-ffmpeg), or [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md#ffmpeg-not-detected-windows) if it isn't found
- A TMDB API Read Access Token (v4) from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
- If running from source: Python 3.11–3.13 with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and Node.js 24 (Python 3.14 is not yet supported — some ML dependencies have no 3.14 wheels)

## Install

### Option A: Standalone executable (Windows, Linux, macOS)

No Python or Node.js required — the Config Wizard opens in your browser on first launch. Download the build for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/Jsakkos/engram/releases) page, extract it, and run the `engram` executable:

| Platform | Download | Run |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Windows | `engram-windows-x64.zip` | `engram.exe` |
| Linux (x64) | `engram-linux-x64.tar.gz` | `./engram/engram` |
| Linux (arm64 / Jetson) | `engram-linux-arm64.tar.gz` | `./engram/engram` |
| macOS | `engram-macos-arm64.tar.gz` | `./engram/engram` |

On Linux arm64 (e.g. NVIDIA Jetson), download `engram-linux-arm64.tar.gz`. ASR runs on the CPU out of the box; GPU acceleration needs an on-device build step — see [Jetson setup](docs/development/jetson.md).

On macOS, download `engram-macos-arm64.tar.gz`. It runs natively on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) and transparently on Intel Macs via Rosetta 2. macOS has no automatic optical-drive detection — use the staging-folder workflow (see [Linux / macOS setup](docs/guide/linux-setup.md)).

> **FFmpeg is required for episode matching.** Engram auto-detects it on your `PATH` (Windows: `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`, then restart Engram). If the Config Wizard reports FFmpeg missing, see [installing FFmpeg](docs/getting-started/installation.md#installing-ffmpeg) and [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md#ffmpeg-not-detected-windows).

### Option B: From source (all platforms)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jsakkos/engram.git
cd engram

# Backend
cd backend
uv sync
cd ..

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

For GPU-accelerated transcription (optional):

```bash
cd backend
uv sync --extra gpu
```

An NVIDIA GPU speeds up episode matching considerably. GPU acceleration is opt-in: enable it in
**Settings → Matching → GPU Acceleration**, which downloads the CUDA runtime on demand — this works
in the prebuilt standalone build too (macOS and AMD GPUs run on CPU). The `uv sync --extra gpu` above
is the from-source shortcut that installs those libraries via pip. See
[Performance & Hardware](docs/guide/performance.md) for GPU setup, storage recommendations, and
concurrency tuning.

Then start the two dev servers in separate terminals:

```bash
# Backend (API on port 8000)
cd backend
uv run uvicorn app.main:app

# Frontend (dashboard on port 5173)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser. See the [installation guide](docs/getting-started/installation.md) for distro-specific prerequisites and verification steps.

### Option C: Docker (Linux)

Run Engram as a container with the optical drive passed through from the host:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jsakkos/engram.git
cd engram
# Set MAKEMKV_APP_KEY (and PUID/PGID) in docker-compose.yml, then:
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:8000 and complete the setup wizard. MakeMKV is compiled
into the `./config` volume on first start (one-time), so the image itself ships
no MakeMKV binaries. Optical-disc ripping requires a real Linux host with a
drive — Docker Desktop on Windows/macOS can run the UI but can't pass through
`/dev/sr0`. See the [Docker deployment guide](docs/deployment/docker.md) for
volumes, device passthrough, GPU notes, and troubleshooting.

## Configuration

On first launch the Config Wizard walks you through setup: MakeMKV path, library paths, TMDB token, and more. Settings are stored in the database and editable from the Settings page.

- **TMDB**: the wizard asks for a **Read Access Token** (v4 auth) from your [TMDB API Settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api). This is the long JWT string starting with `eyJ...`, not the shorter v3 API Key.
- **OpenSubtitles** (optional): for more reliable subtitle downloads, configure an [OpenSubtitles.com](https://www.opensubtitles.com) account (free tier: 5 downloads/day; consumer API keys at [opensubtitles.com/consumers](https://www.opensubtitles.com/en/consumers)). Without credentials, Engram falls back to scraping Addic7ed.

An optional `backend/.env` file can override server-level defaults:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLite connection string | `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./engram.db` |
| `HOST` | Server bind address | `127.0.0.1` |
| `PORT` | Server port | `8000` |
| `DEBUG` | Enable simulation endpoints | `false` |

See the [configuration guide](docs/getting-started/configuration.md) for the full walkthrough and field reference.

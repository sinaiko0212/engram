"""Shared, stateless vectorizer config for the precomputed subtitle cache.

This module is the single source of truth for the hashed TF-IDF feature space.
It is imported by BOTH the offline build script (scripts/build_subtitle_cache.py)
and the runtime matcher (episode_identification.py) so the two can never drift.

The shipped cache contains HASHED TF-IDF vectors only. ``HashingVectorizer`` is
stateless -- no vocabulary is stored or distributed -- so the published artifact
is a non-invertible statistical fingerprint rather than verbatim subtitle text.
A single global IDF array is fit once at build time and shipped alongside it.

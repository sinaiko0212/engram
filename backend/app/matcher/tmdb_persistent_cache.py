"""Disk-backed TMDB cache.

The in-process ``@lru_cache`` on ``tmdb_client._fetch_*_cached`` dedupes
within a single Python run but cannot help across runs of the standalone
``scripts/build_subtitle_cache.py`` — every cold start re-pays the full
TMDB discovery + show/season metadata cost, observed at ~1000 TMDB calls
in a single day on a 300-show build.

This module adds a SQLite layer underneath the LRU. Public wrappers in
``tmdb_client`` check this cache before invoking the LRU-wrapped inner;
a SQLite hit skips both the LRU and the network. A miss falls through to
the network and writes back to SQLite on success.

The cache lives at ``~/.engram/cache/tmdb_cache.sqlite`` — a regen-able
artifact alongside the precomputed-subtitle cache, intentionally NOT in
``engram.db`` so it survives without Alembic migrations and so the
standalone script can use it without the FastAPI lifespan.

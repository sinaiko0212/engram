# effect of ``login()``, ``user_info()``, and ``download()`` — reading the

    errored -- at login time OR mid-run) and ``providers_failed`` (a scraper
    went down hard enough to trip its circuit breaker; see

    Both doors lead to the same defect. A dead scraper and an unsubtitled

    skip-listed for 30 days -- exactly what a June 2026 OpenSubtitles outage
    did to 664 seasons through the first door. Quota exhaustion does not respect season boundaries: it
    can land mid-loop with a few episodes already downloaded, so requiring
    "nothing at all" would let a partial season (e.g. 3/13) get recorded as a
    real 23% coverage measurement and skip-listed for 30 days on the strength
    of an infrastructure failure that happened to land inside that season.
    Recording NO coverage for such a season instead just costs a retry on the
    next run -- cheap and self-correcting, versus a month-long blind spot.

    Conservative by design in the other direction: a fully retrieved season is
    a real measurement whichever provider went down afterwards, because there
    is no gap left for the outage to have hidden. So is a season where every
    provider answered and simply had nothing -- that one SHOULD be recorded, so
    genuinely dead seasons stop consuming quota. One dead scraper plus one
    healthy one is judged on the same rule: complete records, incomplete

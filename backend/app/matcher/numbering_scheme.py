"""How a harvested subtitle-reference season is numbered.

The subtitle providers Engram harvests and TMDB do not always number a season
the same way. For a segment-format show TMDB catalogues each ~7-minute short
(38 entries for Dexter's Laboratory season 1) while the providers index the
22-minute broadcast half-hours those shorts were assembled into (13). The
reference corpus is stored under canonical TMDB season keys either way, so a
code that comes out of the matcher looks like a TMDB coordinate whether or not
it is one. That stays invisible until something dereferences the code, and the
#200 ordering projection is the only thing that does, which is how a track
matched as S01E01 came to be filed as S01E19.mkv.

The published cache records which scheme each season was harvested in so no
consumer has to infer it. This module is the single definition of that
vocabulary, imported by both builder scripts and by the runtime, so the code
that writes the marker and the code that reads it cannot drift.

Deliberately NOT a value here: "tvdb". TheTVDB numbers Dexter's Laboratory by
segment in both its official order (38/108/36/38, identical to TMDB) and its
DVD order (39 for season 1), so the corpus's 13/40/13/13 is not TVDB numbering
and the providers' scheme matches no catalogue Engram can name. Rationale:
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-20-subtitle-cache-numbering-scheme-design.md.

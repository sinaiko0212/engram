"""TVsubtitles.net subtitle scraper.

TVsubtitles.net is a small TV-focused community site with simple, stable
HTML structure. Coverage is thinner than OpenSubtitles or Addic7ed but
non-zero for English episodes of mainstream shows — useful as a fallback
when the other providers are exhausted or rate-limited.

URL chain (verified live 2026-05-20 via curl):

1.  ``POST /search1.php`` with form field ``qs={show_name}``
    → HTML page; the first ``/tvshow-{id}.html`` anchor is the top hit.
    (The search is **POST** with field name ``qs`` — not the
    ``GET /search.php?q=`` shape various stale third-party docs claim.)

2.  ``GET /tvshow-{id}-{season}.html``
    → Season page. Each episode row contains a ``<td>{S}x{EE}</td>`` cell
    (NOT ``S01E01``) and an ``<a href="/episode-{n}.html">`` link
    elsewhere in the same row.

3.  ``GET /episode-{n}.html``
    → Lists every uploaded subtitle. English subtitles are identified by
    ``<div title="Download English subtitles" class="subtitlen">``
    inside an ``<a href="/subtitle-{m}.html">`` anchor.

4.  ``GET /subtitle-{m}.html``
    → A landing page with a "Download" anchor pointing at
    ``/download-{m}.html``.

5.  ``GET /download-{m}.html``
    → **Response varies with cookie state**. A cookieless request
    receives a tiny HTML stub with a JavaScript redirect that assembles
    a ``files/...zip`` path from string fragments (anti-scraping).
    After step 4 sets the ``visited1`` and ``lfp`` session cookies,
    the SAME URL streams the ZIP directly with no intermediate hop.
    We detect which form we got via the ZIP magic bytes ``PK\\x03\\x04``
    and fall back to JS parsing + a final ``/files/...zip`` GET only
    if we somehow lost the cookies.

This client is conservative on rate (1 req/sec) because the site is
small and aggressive scraping risks an IP block.

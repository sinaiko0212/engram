"""Manual subtitle bulk-import: preview/commit logic for user-supplied .srt files.

Feeds directly into the existing subtitle cache that ``LocalSubtitleProvider``
scans (``subtitle_provider.py``) — writing a correctly-named file there makes it
available to matching identically to an automated find, so this module owns
parsing/validation/writing only and never touches the matcher.

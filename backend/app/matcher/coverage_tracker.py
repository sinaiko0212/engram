"""Persistent record of subtitle-harvest coverage per (show, season).

The build script's per-season coverage threshold (``--min-episodes-ratio``,
default 0.6) historically only gated which seasons make it into the
precomputed tarball — every daily re-run re-attempted the same dead
seasons, burning the OpenSubtitles VIP quota and Addic7ed/TVsubtitles
rate-limit budget on shows that simply don't have subtitles.

This module persists "(show, season) → (attempted_at, coverage_ratio)"
in the same SQLite file as the TMDB cache, so the build script can skip
seasons whose prior attempt fell below threshold within the configured
window. ``--retry-low-coverage`` bypasses the skip when the user wants
to re-attempt after adding a provider or after VIP quota refills.

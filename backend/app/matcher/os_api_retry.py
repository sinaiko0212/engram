"""Unified retry/backoff helper for opensubtitlescom calls.

The OpenSubtitles best-practices doc requires honoring the ``Retry-After``
response header on 429 responses. Unfortunately the installed library
(``opensubtitlescom``) wraps ``requests.HTTPError`` into a bare
``OpenSubtitlesException(str(http_err))`` in ``send_api`` and discards the
response object, so we cannot read the header in practice today.

This helper:

1. Honors ``Retry-After`` defensively via ``getattr(exc, "response", None)``,
   in case a future library version preserves the response (then we
   automatically benefit with no further changes).
2. Falls back to capped exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s, 40s by default)
   when the header is not available — which is the current real-world path.
3. Detects rate limiting via substring match on the exception (``"429" in
   str(exc)``), matching what the rest of the codebase does, so the warning
   log lines correctly identify rate limits vs. transient network errors.

All three OpenSubtitles call sites (``client.login``, ``client.search``,
``client.download_and_save``) route through this helper for consistent
behavior — before this helper, login used an inline loop in
``testing_service.py`` while search/download used a generic
``retry_with_backoff`` decorator in ``subtitle_provider.py`` with different
parameters.

#   HIGH_VOTE_REF   — absolute chunk count for "full vote" credit. Deep re-match

#   MAX_VOTE_BOOST  — maximum separation added by combined consensus + vote credit.

#   HIGH_VOTE_RATIO         — winner must have this many times the runner-up's
#     vote count for full ratio credit (e.g. 103 vs 31 = 3.3×).

    Rationale for Path 2: ranked_voting_score is a per-chunk mean cosine, so
    a runner-up that matched ⅓ as many chunks as the winner may still produce
    a similar mean cosine (and thus a small score_gap). Path 1 alone then

        Get the duration of the subtitle file (max end timestamp across all cues).

        Uses max() instead of the last cue because some subtitle files have
        watermark/ad blocks appended at the end with timestamps near 0:00,
        which would incorrectly report the duration as ~2 seconds.

"""Threaded multi-provider scheduler for subtitle downloads.

The single-threaded loop in ``testing_service.download_subtitles`` used to
try Addic7ed for every episode, then the OpenSubtitles.org scraper for
every miss — both blocking on per-provider rate-limit sleeps (3s and 6s
respectively). While provider A was sleeping, provider B sat idle.

This module replaces that loop with one worker thread per provider, each
holding its own client and rate-limit state. Episode jobs flow through a
provider-priority list: when provider A fails, the job is re-queued at
provider B; meanwhile provider A's worker is already serving a different
episode. The total wall-time for a season approaches
``max(per_provider_time)`` rather than ``sum(per_provider_time)``.

Public surface:
- ``EpisodeJob`` — dataclass describing one episode's lifecycle.
- ``ProviderWorker`` — thread that pulls jobs for one provider.
- ``Scheduler`` — wires workers together and waits for completion.
- ``ProviderHealth`` / ``SchedulerRun`` -- per-provider reachability, so a
  caller can tell "this provider had nothing" from "this provider never
  answered".
- ``run_jobs(jobs, workers)`` — convenience entry point; returns a
  ``SchedulerRun``, not a bare results dict.

Worker contract (any provider):
- ``client.get_best_subtitle(show, season, episode) -> entry | None``
- ``client.download_subtitle(entry, save_path) -> Path | None``

This matches ``Addic7edClient`` and ``TVSubtitlesClient``.

    every breaker starts closed at a season boundary and a trip always means
    "this provider went down during THIS season". If breakers are ever made
    process-global (a separate follow-up, to stop re-paying a dead provider's
    timeouts each season), that stops being true and a provider could be
    breaker-open for a season it never attempted; such a season would then have
    to count as failed too, for the same reason a mid-season trip does.

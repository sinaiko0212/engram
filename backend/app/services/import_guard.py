"""Ownership rules for manual-import staging paths (issue #571).

A staging path is *owned* by an in-flight job and merely *recorded* by a
finished one:

* in-flight (any non-terminal state, including REVIEW_NEEDED) hard-blocks, because
  a second job would race the first over the same files on disk;
* COMPLETED soft-blocks, because it is history rather than a live claim, and an
  explicit user re-import overrides it;
* FAILED never blocks.

Deliberately NOT a copy of the disc-side guard in ``job_manager._on_disc_inserted``,
which lets REVIEW_NEEDED through: a disc in review has been ejected and the drive
is free, whereas an import in review still holds its files.

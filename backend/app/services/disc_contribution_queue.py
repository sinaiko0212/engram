"""Whole-disc layout contribution enqueue (Phase C client write path).

When a disc job reaches COMPLETED, we capture the disc's content hash plus its
full title→assignment mapping and append it to the local ``disc_contributions``
table. A later uploader (Phase C-B2) drains that table to ``POST /v1/contribute-
disc``; once enough independent users contribute the same disc with the same
mapping, the network promotes it so future inserts skip audio matching.

This module is the PRODUCER half only — it never uploads. It is best-effort:
a failure here must never break job completion.

    - anything else (unmatched / skipped / discarded) → "discarded"

    Note on the TV/MOVIE asymmetry: a TV title keeps "episode" purely from its
    SxxExx code, regardless of organize state — the code itself is the identity.
    A MOVIE main feature has no code to key on, so it additionally requires the
    kept/COMPLETED (organized) state before we call it "main_movie". This asymmetry
    is intentional and conservative: without a code, organize state is the only
    signal that the title is the feature rather than a discarded/extra track.

    Note on multi-episode codes: a combined code like ``S01E01-E02`` is sent as
    "discarded" for now. The fingerprint server types a row's episode as an integer
    or null, so a range such as ``"1-2"`` would make it reject the whole disc
    payload with a 400, and the uploader treats a 4xx as permanent, so every row on
    the disc would be lost rather than just this one. The client reader in
    fingerprint_disc_classifier also drops a non-integer episode, so the range could
    not round-trip anyway. Under-counting one row keeps the rest of the layout. The
    TheDiscDB export, whose ingest accepts strings, keeps the range form.

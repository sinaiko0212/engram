"""Background transcript prewarmer for review-parked jobs.

When a job parks in REVIEW_NEEDED its unresolved tracks are very likely to be
re-matched soon (the user reassigns an episode, re-identifies the show, or hits
"Re-match all"). Re-matching re-transcribes the same canonical scan-grid chunks
Whisper already saw — unless they are sitting in the persistent transcript
store (``app/matcher/transcript_store.py``, the L2 cache under
``transcribe_chunk_cached``). This service fills that store in the background
while the job idles in review, so the eventual re-match is near-instant.

Design notes
------------
* **One dedicated EpisodeMatcher**, built lazily in a thread on first use.
  It is constructed with the SAME model-affecting args production matching
  uses (see ``EpisodeCurator._ensure_initialized``): default model name,
  startup-pinned device, ``requested_workers`` from config — so its
  ``model_key`` (and even its ``get_cached_model`` cache slot) match what live
  matching produces and looks up. ``show_name`` does not affect transcription;
  a sentinel is used.
* **Coverage check without a model load**: the model-free
  ``model_output_key(matcher._model_config())`` plus ``transcript_store.get``
  per offset decide whether anything is missing. A fully-cached file never
  touches the Whisper loader.
* **Honest-key recheck**: after the model loads, ``_model_key_for(model)``
  may differ from the config-derived key (CUDA→CPU fallback). When it does,
  coverage is re-checked under the honest key before transcribing.
* **Semaphore per chunk**: each chunk acquires the matching semaphore and
  releases it before the next one, so a live match preempts the prewarmer
  between chunks instead of queueing behind a whole file.
* **Fail-soft everywhere**: a chunk or file failure logs and continues; the
  background task can never propagate into job state.

        deletes the truncated in-flight file, an interrupted track and a
        never-started track are both fileless and indistinguishable to it.
        Routing after reconcile would silently produce FAILED, non-re-rippable

        route_rip_failure_to_review is itself a no-op for titles outside

        which also makes a second call idempotent: the first call left them in
        REVIEW, so the query below no longer selects them.

        DB state alone is not enough to decide "unfinished". The extractor's
        final completion poll fires title_complete_callback for a title that
        finished just before the abort, and that callback is marshalled onto

        A gate-D unknown-season disc matches every title across ALL seasons
        (``detected_season is None`` → the matcher's season-unknown path),
        which is expensive: TF-IDF against every season's references, per
        title. Physical discs are season-coherent in practice, so once two
        MATCHED titles agree on a season — with zero MATCHED disagreement —
        the disc's season is effectively known. Pinning it makes subsequent
        title dispatches take the cheap single-season path (each title
        re-reads the job row in its own fresh session, both for the duration
        pre-filter and for the matcher call) and re-engages the chromaprint
        prepass (curator.match_single_file only runs the prepass when
        ``season`` is truthy — the season-unknown branch returns before it).
        Matches already in flight keep the season value they captured; they
        finish their cross-season scan undisturbed.

        Only MATCHED titles vote: REVIEW-state titles (low-confidence guesses)
        and unparseable ``matched_episode`` values ("extra", None) are never
        counted, on either side of the agree/disagree rule.

        CONSTRAINT — imports must never pin: a flat watch-folder import
        (``drive_id == "import"``) legitimately mixes episodes from MANY
        seasons in one job, and its early titles can easily land same-season
        by chance; pinning would then force every later title through the
        wrong single-season scan. The zero-disagreement rule protects discs
        (a genuinely mixed disc accrues a disagreeing MATCHED title and never
        reaches 0-disagree), but it cannot protect an import's first two
        titles — so imports are excluded outright.

        Concurrency: parallel titles can commit MATCHED near-simultaneously
        and both evaluate this. Double-pinning DIFFERENT seasons is
        impossible: the MATCHED set only grows during matching, and a pin
        requires every parsed MATCHED season to agree — a later evaluation
        sees a superset that still contains the first pin's agreeing titles,
        so conflicting evidence fails the zero-disagree rule instead. The
        worst race residue is a duplicate pin of the SAME season (an
        idempotent re-commit plus a duplicate broadcast).

        Also retires a ``kind="season"`` identity CTA in the same commit —
        the question answered itself. Blocking kinds (name/reidentify) are
        left alone: they shouldn't coexist with MATCHED titles (blocking
        prompts park titles QUEUED), but if one ever does, only the answer
        endpoints may clear it.

"""Re-validate title indices after extraction moves from the disc to its backup.

``DiscTitle`` rows are created from the *disc* scan and carry ``title_index``,
which is what the rip command passes to MakeMKV. Extraction now runs against
``file:<backup>``, so a re-scan may enumerate differently. A backup is a byte
copy and almost always enumerates identically, but "almost always" is not a
contract, and ripping the wrong index files an episode under another episode's
name with no error anywhere: the mis-file is invisible until someone browses
their library months later.

So the reconciliation here is deliberately timid. It maps an index only when
exactly one backup title can be it, and reports AMBIGUOUS otherwise. AMBIGUOUS
is meant to park the job for human review, never to trigger a guess and never
to fall back to the drive, which may already be ejected.

Design notes
------------

**Identity signal.** A title is identified by ``(source_filename, segment_map)``
plus a duration that agrees within a tolerance. ``source_filename`` (MakeMKV
TINFO attr 16, e.g. ``00001.m2ts``) and ``segment_map`` (attr 26, e.g.
``1,2,3``) name actual objects inside the disc structure, so a byte-identical
backup reproduces them exactly while the enumeration position may shift. Both
are routinely empty (DVDs, and any row scanned before those fields existed), so
duration is not merely a tiebreaker: for a disc with no per-title metadata it is
the only signal there is, and it must still be able to tell two titles apart.

**Duration is compared, never hashed.** An earlier draft bucketed the duration
into a hash key (``duration // tolerance``). That cannot express "within N
seconds": bucketing puts 2600 and 2601 in different buckets whenever the
boundary falls between them, so a one-second MakeMKV rounding difference read as
a different title. Instead the ``(source_filename, segment_map)`` pair is the
only hashed part of the key, and duration is checked with an explicit
``abs(a - b) <= tolerance`` against each candidate that shares that pair.

**Not ``output_index``.** ``DiscTitle.output_index`` is the disc-native ``_tNN``
number and is a better *rip target* than ``title_index`` (see
``ripping_helpers.expected_native_index``), but it is a poor *identity* signal
here. It is nullable on legacy rows and wherever MakeMKV supplied no suggested
filename, and the scan side does not carry a comparable field at all:
``TitleInfo`` holds the raw suggested filename (``disc_title``), from which the
number is only recovered by re-parsing. Worst of all it is derived from
MakeMKV's own numbering, which is exactly the thing a re-enumeration would
change, so it cannot corroborate itself. ``source_filename``/``segment_map``
name disc structure instead, which is what a byte copy preserves.

It is, however, a rip *target*, so it cannot be left holding its disc-scan
value once extraction reads the backup: see
``job_manager._reconcile_backup_titles``, which re-derives it from the backup
scan's ``disc_title`` for every row this module lines up.

    Index and duration alone are not enough: two adjacent titles of similar
    length that swapped position would satisfy both checks pair-for-pair while
    holding each other's content. So whenever BOTH sides of a pair carry
    identity metadata (``source_filename``/``segment_map``), that metadata
    must also agree before the pair counts as identical. Only a pair with NO
    metadata on either side (e.g. a DVD scan where neither field was ever
    populated) skips that comparison and relies on index+duration alone, which
    is the case this fast path exists for.

    ``disc_title`` (MakeMKV's suggested output filename, from which
    ``DiscTitle.output_index`` is derived) is deliberately NOT compared here.
    Two enumerations that agree on index, duration and disc structure but
    suggest different ``_tNN`` numbers are still the same titles in the same
    order, and failing them into the fingerprint pass would risk parking a
    perfectly good backup as AMBIGUOUS. The stale-``output_index`` hazard that
    difference would otherwise create is closed at the caller instead:
    ``job_manager._reconcile_backup_titles`` re-derives ``output_index`` from
    the backup scan for EVERY row, on the IDENTICAL path as well as the
    REMAPPED one, so this function never has to be the thing that notices.

    A pair where exactly one side carries metadata and the other doesn't is
    treated as NOT identical, on purpose: a backup re-scan losing metadata the
    disc scan had (or gaining metadata it lacked) means the two enumerations
    disagree about what there is to compare, which is itself a sign they may
    not correspond. Falling through to the fingerprint pass below is safe here
    because that pass keys strictly on matching metadata; a one-sided pair
    will fail to find a candidate there and correctly resolve to AMBIGUOUS
    rather than a silent (and possibly wrong) IDENTICAL.

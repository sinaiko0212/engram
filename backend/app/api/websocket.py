        Flat, like every other message this class emits: the frontend reads

        "data" envelope silently produced an undefined job id and a progress

        the client already had. This message is a self-contained progress
        sample, so a null means "not known for this sample" and the client
        coalesces it against what it is already showing. Expect ``speed`` to
        stay None in practice: MakeMKV's backup reports a percentage, not a

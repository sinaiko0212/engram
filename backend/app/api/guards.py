"""Network-origin FastAPI dependencies shared by the API routers.

These live here rather than in ``routes.py`` so a router that needs a gate does
not have to import the whole route module to get one. ``validation.py`` importing
``routes.py`` for ``require_localhost_or_lan`` created an import cycle
(``routes.py`` imports ``validation.py`` back, inside function bodies), which
CodeQL flags and which makes the dependency direction between the two routers
ambiguous. Both now depend on this leaf module instead.

``routes.py`` re-exports these names, so existing imports and the
``app.dependency_overrides[require_localhost]`` pattern used across the test
suite keep working unchanged.

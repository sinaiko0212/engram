"""Understanding and checking the paths a user configures.

Engram writes into directories the user names in Settings, and those are the
settings most likely to be wrong in a way nothing notices: a typo, a share that
isn't mounted, a Docker volume owned by another uid. Left unchecked the mistake
surfaces hours later as an organize failure after a completed rip, which is the
worst possible moment to learn about it.

Network locations get first-class treatment here because they are the normal case
for a media library. On Windows that means UNC paths (``\\\\server\\share``);
elsewhere a share is an ordinary mount point and needs nothing special — but a
Windows-style UNC typed on Linux is a mistake worth naming rather than silently
treating as a relative directory.

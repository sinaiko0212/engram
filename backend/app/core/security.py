"""Security helpers: SSRF URL validation, executable allowlisting, log sanitizing.

These back the hardening of CodeQL-flagged sinks:

- ``is_allowed_image_url`` — guards the ``fetch_cover`` outbound HTTP request.
- ``executable_basename_allowed`` — constrains the tool-validation subprocess
  calls to executables that actually look like the expected tool.
- ``is_within_configured_roots`` — constrains media-endpoint file paths to the
  configured staging and library roots.
- ``is_safe_local_ai_url`` — a deliberately permissive guard for the
  user-configured local AI server base URL, which must accept loopback.
- ``sanitize_log_value`` — strips line breaks/control characters from
  disc/user-controlled values before they are written to logs.
- ``sanitize_playlist_field`` — strips line breaks/control characters from
  disc-derived text before it is embedded in an ``.m3u`` playlist.

The first four are boolean *predicates* — they return ``True``/``False`` so
the validation is recognised as a barrier guard by static analysis at the call
site (``if not guard(x): ...``). ``sanitize_log_value`` and
``sanitize_playlist_field`` instead return the cleaned value, the recognised
barrier shape for log/playlist injection.

    Deliberately NOT is_safe_remote_url. That guard rejects loopback, private
    and link-local hosts to prevent SSRF, and those are precisely the addresses
    an Ollama or LM Studio server listens on, so this is an intentional
    exemption rather than an oversight.

    Scope of that exemption, stated plainly because the function name understates
    it: apart from the link-local and metadata hosts denied below, this imposes
    NO restriction on the host. A public address passes. That is intended, since
    a user may legitimately run their inference server on another machine, but it
    means this guard is not what stops a hostile endpoint being configured.

    The server issues real requests to this URL, so it is a request-forgery
    primitive. It is accepted because the config surface is already fully trusted
    (it holds API keys, filesystem paths and library roots) and because the
    endpoints that write it are gated by require_localhost_or_lan. Note that the
    primitive is blind only on the completion path: the model-list endpoint
    returns the ids it parses out of the response, so a JSON body shaped like
    OpenAI's /v1/models is partially reflected to the caller. That is why the
    metadata hosts are denied outright. See
    docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-29-local-ai-provider-design.md.

    Whitespace and control characters are rejected against the RAW string, before
    parsing. CPython strips tab, CR and LF out of a URL before urlparse sees it,
    so without this check "http://localhost\n.evil.com" would be validated as
    the host "localhost.evil.com" while the caller sent the original bytes, and
    httpx would raise InvalidURL, which is not an httpx.HTTPError subclass and so
    escapes the transport handler in ai_client. Keeping the judged string and the
    sent string identical is what makes this a real barrier. It also keeps CR/LF
    out of a value that reaches the logs.

    Also rejected: non-http(s) schemes (file:, javascript:, ftp:), a missing
    host, embedded credentials, query, fragment, path parameters, a port outside
    the valid range, and any ".." path segment. The traversal check matters
    because callers append "/chat/completions" or "/models" to this value, so a

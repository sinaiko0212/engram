"""What a job points MakeMKV at.

MakeMKV accepts three source forms: ``dev:<drive or device>``, ``disc:<index>``
and ``file:<path>`` (a backup folder or an ISO). Engram historically assumed the
first, so "is this source a physical drive?" was answered ad hoc with string
tests at every call site that needed eject, sentinel re-arm, drive locking or
progress labelling. This module is the single answer.

Pure apart from ``resolve_disc_index``, which shells out to makemkvcon to map a
drive letter to a MakeMKV disc index.

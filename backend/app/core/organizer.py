        edition: Edition label (e.g. "Final Cut"). Rendered via the ``{edition}``
            placeholder in the FILENAME format; Plex reads the tag off the file.
            Passed as a real argument rather than concatenated into ``movie_name``
            so ``clean_movie_name`` cannot flatten it (#576).
        already_clean: True when ``movie_name`` is a canonical TMDB title that must
            not be run through ``clean_movie_name`` (which is built for volume
            labels and would turn "Spider-Man" into "Spider Man").
        extra_files: The exact files to treat as extras, instead of every other MKV
            in the main file's folder. A manual import's folder belongs to the user
            and may hold MKVs the job never scanned; sweeping those into Extras/
            would move files nobody asked Engram to touch (#676). ``None`` keeps
            the folder scan, which is right for Engram's own staging directory.

"""Recursive scanner for manual media import.

Given a folder (or a single .mkv file) chosen by the user, walk the tree, find
every .mkv at any depth, and group the files into import units keyed by
(show, season). Intermediate folders that are not "Season NN" (for example
"Disc 1") are transparent: we recurse through them and roll their files up into
the inferred season.

This is the single source of truth for which files belong to which import job,
so the preview and the actual import are always consistent. Pure and
synchronous; callers run it via asyncio.to_thread. No network calls.

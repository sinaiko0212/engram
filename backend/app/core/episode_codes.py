"""Canonical parsing/formatting for episode codes, including multi-episode tracks.

A ``DiscTitle.matched_episode`` is normally one episode (``"S01E07"``), but a
single DVD track can legitimately contain several TMDB episodes — segment-format
cartoons, which pack three ~7min segments into a 22min broadcast slot, are the
common case. Those tracks are represented with the Plex/Jellyfin multi-episode
form ``"S01E01-E03"``: one canonical string, one file, several episodes.

Everything that reads an episode code should go through here rather than
re-implementing ``S(\\d+)E(\\d+)``, so a multi-episode code is either understood
or *explicitly* reduced to its first part — never silently truncated.

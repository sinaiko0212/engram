"""Network disc-identification read path (walk-away Phase C, client side).

Given a disc's content hash, query the companion fingerprint server's
``GET /v1/identify-disc`` endpoint. On a crowd-promoted hit the server returns
an identity (tmdb_id + content type) and a per-title episode mapping, letting a
disc the network has already seen be identified with ZERO audio matching.

**Best-effort semantics.** This is a supplementary signal layered onto the
existing classification pipeline. Every failure mode — network error, HTTP
error, malformed JSON, a garbage/odd-length content hash, or a miss — returns
``None`` and NEVER raises, so classification proceeds with TMDB/AI/heuristics
exactly as before when the network is unreachable or unhelpful.

**Hash encoding.** ``content_hash`` is the uppercase-hex MD5 string stored on
the job (TheDiscDB-compatible fingerprint). The server keys discs on the RAW
MD5 bytes, base64url-encoded WITHOUT padding. We therefore decode the hex back
to the 16 raw bytes and re-encode: ``base64.urlsafe_b64encode(raw).rstrip(b"=")``.
This MUST match how the WRITE path (uploader) encodes ``disc_content_hash`` so a
disc we contributed can later be looked up.

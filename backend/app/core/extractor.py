    as the scan-order ``DiscTitle.title_index``, but not guaranteed — some
    discs number titles starting at 1 (no "t00") or with gaps (issue #517).
    Callers that need to map a ripped filename back to a specific

    True only when BOTH hold:

    * the title MakeMKV just opened is user-skipped, and
    * every title still ahead of it is user-skipped too.

    That is exactly the case where stopping costs nothing: the previous title
    finished, the file just created is still a stub, and no wanted title
    remains on the disc. Any other skip is honored by letting the pass run to
    the end and deleting the skipped title's file once MakeMKV finishes it
    (``job_manager._on_title_ripped``). Killing the process mid-title instead
    threw away the rip in flight — which is why skipping a *later* track used
    to stop the *current* one.

    "Still ahead" is ``native > opened_native``: MakeMKV saves titles in
    ascending disc-native order. That is a stronger assumption than the
    completion detector's, which needs only that one title is written at a
    time; ordering is what lets the caller take the highest newly-appeared
    native as "the title just opened". Ordering is deliberate rather than
    tracking which titles have been seen — ``makemkvcon mkv <disc> all``
    applies MakeMKV's own selection profile, so a short title the scan
    recorded may never be written at all. A seen-set rule would leave such a
    title outstanding forever and the abort could never fire; with ordering,
    only a filtered title *above* the current one suppresses it, and
    suppressing is fail-safe (the pass simply runs to the end).

    ``opened_native`` is MakeMKV's disc-native title number, parsed from the
    output filename. ``disc_title_map`` maps that number to the scan-order
    ``DiscTitle.title_index`` the skip set is keyed on; the two diverge on some

    MakeMKV writes one title at a time and emits no reliable per-title "done"
    signal on stdout (its PRGC/PRGV codes carry no title index), so completion
    is inferred from the ``*.mkv`` files in the output directory. The detector
    is fed a ``{filename: size}`` snapshot on each poll and reports which files

    A file is reported complete only when MakeMKV has **demonstrably moved on**:

    Size-stability *alone* is deliberately not trusted. MakeMKV pauses writes
    mid-title on slow or dirty discs, holding a file's size constant for many

    the red RIPPING state and the green matched/idle state for the rest of the

    impossible: the last/only title of a rip is finalized by the post-process

        because the process did not exit naturally, so the file MakeMKV was

        "Since the last poll" is what couples this to the caller: the answer is

        is therefore evaluated immediately after a completion poll and nowhere

        the ``.partial`` is left in place: a partial backup of a dying disc has
        salvage value, and discarding it is the user's call.

        Every attempt starts from a clean ``<dest>.partial`` working directory,
        and this is REQUIRED, not merely tidy. Verified against MakeMKV 1.18.3
        on real hardware: a target directory that already exists is refused
        outright, even when it is empty, with ``MSG:5068 "Folder ... already
        contains a backup, please choose another folder"`` followed by
        ``Backup failed``. So a stale ``.partial`` left by a previous failed
        attempt is moved aside to ``<dest>.partial.previous`` before MakeMKV is
        launched; without that, every retry of a failed backup would die
        instantly on 5068. It also follows that this method must never
        pre-create the ``.partial`` itself: only ``dest.parent`` is created
        here. That keeps the most recent failed attempt
        around for salvage while dropping the older one: a disc that fails
        repeatedly would otherwise accumulate tens of gigabytes per attempt
        without bound. This debris is from a *failed* attempt, not a completed
        backup, so Engram's "never delete a backup" rule (which is about
        completed backups under the backup root) does not apply to it.

        Deliberately has no stall watchdog, unlike ``rip_titles``. A backup is
        a single sequential read of the whole disc with no per-title boundary
        to skip to, so the rip's "kill it and move to the next title" recovery
        has no analogue here. Cancellation is the escape hatch for an
        interactive user, and the job-level phase watchdog
        (``timeout_backing_up_seconds``) is the unattended backstop.

"""Live HTTP tests for the TVsubtitles.net client.

See ``tests/live/conftest.py`` for opt-in mechanics. These tests pick
Breaking Bad S01E01 — a long-running, very-broadly-subtitled episode —
and walk the full TVsubtitles URL chain:

  POST /search1.php  →  /tvshow-{id}-{season}.html  →
  /episode-{n}.html  →  /subtitle-{m}.html  →
  /download-{m}.html  (JS redirect)  →  /files/{name}.zip

If any step fails, the assertion message points at the parser that
needs updating, since the unit-test fixtures only validate against
captured HTML and won't catch layout drift.

CodeQL note: variables that are assigned only inside a ``try`` whose
``except`` calls ``pytest.skip()`` look uninitialised to CodeQL's
``py/uninitialized-local`` check — the analyser doesn't know that
``pytest.skip`` raises. We pre-init those locals to ``None`` so the
write is unconditional from CodeQL's perspective; the runtime semantics
are unchanged (``pytest.skip`` still raises before the assertion runs).

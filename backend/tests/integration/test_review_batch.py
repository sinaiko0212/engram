"""Integration tests for the batch review endpoint.

Tests POST /api/jobs/{id}/review/batch — applying multiple review decisions in a
single atomic request. This is what backs the review-tab multiselect "mark all
as extras" workflow, and the single finalize pass it runs is what keeps many
extras from colliding on FILE_EXISTS during organization.

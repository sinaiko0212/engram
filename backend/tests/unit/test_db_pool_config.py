"""Regression guard for the database connection-pool configuration.

These tests pin the fix for the QueuePool exhaustion that struck multi-season
imports (7 Seinfeld seasons matching concurrently + a rip): SQLAlchemy's async
default pool of 5 + 10 = 15 connections was too small for the app's fan-out, and
the absence of a SQLite busy_timeout meant concurrent writers failed fast with
"database is locked" instead of queueing. See app/config.py:db_pool_size and
app/database.py:set_sqlite_pragma.

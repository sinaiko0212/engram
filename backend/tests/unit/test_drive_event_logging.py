"""Regression tests: failures while handling a disc-insert event must be loud.

A DiscJob INSERT failure on disc insertion was once completely silent — it
propagated to the Sentinel's generic "Error in async callback" handler, which
logged it without a traceback and (before the InterceptHandler fix) misattributed
it. The contract now is:

- ``_on_drive_event`` lets job-creation failures propagate, so its direct API
  caller (``/simulate/trigger-real-scan``) still surfaces a 500 instead of a
  bogus success.
- The Sentinel's ``_notify`` backstop logs a failing callback with a traceback,
  keeping the physical-disc path observable.

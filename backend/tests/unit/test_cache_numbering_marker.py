"""The published manifest records how each harvested season is numbered.

Without the marker no backend can tell a canonical TMDB code from a
broadcast-half-hour code, because both come out of the matcher shaped like
SxxEyy under a canonical season key.

``build_subtitle_cache._season_numbering_entry`` is the single implementation
for both builder scripts; ``pack_subtitle_cache`` wraps it to add only its
``offline`` short-circuit. The two scripts publish to the same rolling release,
so the tests are split along that seam: the build class covers the shared
classification behaviour, the pack class covers only what pack adds. Neither
script gets its own copy of the logic to drift.

The roster-lookup paths get the most attention because they are where a wrong
answer is silent: a lookup that returns 0 (the no-key and transient-failure
contract of ``fetch_season_details``) must emit "unknown" rather than
"divergent", or a TMDB blip during a nightly build would brand healthy seasons
unverified for a whole release.

The `psc` and `bsc` fixtures (session-scoped, in conftest.py) load the standalone
scripts as modules. Nothing here touches the network or the real cache.

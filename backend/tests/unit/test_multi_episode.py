"""Unit tests for positional vote-run decomposition.

Root cause these guard against: a DVD track holding two ~11-minute cartoon segments
matched no single TMDB runtime and was filed as an extra without ever being
transcribed (issue #622). Duration cannot distinguish a conjoined 3-episode track
from a 3-episode Play All, but the POSITION of each chunk vote can: conjoined
episodes produce contiguous, balanced runs along the timeline, and the chunk
straddling the seam abstains (see select_chunk_vote's rank+margin rule).

CI-safe: pure functions over synthetic vote lists. No MKV/audio/Whisper.

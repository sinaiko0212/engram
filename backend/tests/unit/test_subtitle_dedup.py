"""Unit tests for cross-episode subtitle de-duplication.

Regression coverage for the harvester contamination found in the DS9 cache:
a provider returned S01E05's dialogue ("Babel") for an S02E05 request, so the
two SRTs carried identical dialogue with only different timestamps. The cache
builder then vectorized identical text into two episode slots, and matching for
those episodes degraded to "no clear vote". The guard must catch a saved SRT
whose cleaned dialogue is identical to a *different* episode already on disk.

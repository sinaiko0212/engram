"""Unit tests for the ownership guard in JobManager.create_job_from_staging.

A staging path can be re-submitted at any time (a manual re-import, a retry after
a mistake, a server restart). Ownership, not history, decides whether that is
allowed:

* an in-flight job hard-blocks, so two jobs can never race over the same files;
* a COMPLETED job soft-blocks, and an explicit ``force=True`` re-import overrides it;
* a FAILED job never blocks (regression guard: jobs left FAILED by a cancel or a
  restart recovery once silently wedged re-import).

The soft tier replaced an unconditional block on every non-FAILED state, which
was inherited from the polled watch folder PR #463 removed and left users renaming
folders to escape it (issue #571). See
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-04-import-reimport-recovery-design.md.

"""Issue #506: the stale-job watchdog must not masquerade as a user cancel.

``reconcile_and_advance`` cancels the in-flight rip task before force-advancing the
job's still-active titles. ``Task.cancel()`` only *schedules* CancelledError at the
cancelled coroutine's next await, so ``_run_ripping``'s handler runs concurrently
with the reconcile pass. Two defects fell out of that:

* the handler recorded ``"Cancelled by user"`` for an internal timeout, so a
  watchdog trip was indistinguishable from a genuine user cancel, and
* its unconditional FAILED write clobbered the REVIEW_NEEDED that reconcile had
  just computed. That clobber is unrecoverable rather than merely out-of-order:
  ``check_job_completion`` returns early on an already-terminal job, so once
  FAILED lands the intended outcome can never be re-derived. The user was left
  pointed at a review queue that the job state locked them out of.

The tests below drive the *real* concurrent path — the rip is parked mid-await when
the cancellation is delivered — rather than calling the two coroutines in a fixed
order, so they would catch a regression that merely reorders the writes.

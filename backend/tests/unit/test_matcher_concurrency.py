"""Regression tests for EpisodeMatcher thread-safety under parallel ASR.

The shared ``curator`` singleton holds ONE ``EpisodeMatcher`` per (show, tmdb_id).
Since #336 (parallel ASR) several titles match concurrently via
``asyncio.to_thread``, so multiple threads call ``identify_episode`` on the SAME
matcher instance. The per-season working state (the TF-IDF matcher built from a
season's references) must NOT be shared across those calls: a Season 9 title
mid-scan whose references get rebuilt to Season 8 by a concurrent thread matches
its audio against the wrong season → zero votes → bogus review.

These tests force that cross-season interleaving deterministically.

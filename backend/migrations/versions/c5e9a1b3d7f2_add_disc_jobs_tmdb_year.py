"""add disc_jobs.tmdb_year

Persists the resolved show's first-air year on a job so the organizer can build
a disambiguated library folder (e.g. Frasier 1993 #3452 vs the 2023 revival
#195241) deterministically and offline. Resolved at identify time from the
same-name candidates (no extra network) or a cached TMDB details lookup. Mirrors
the database.py reconciler path used by frozen builds (which skip Alembic) — the
two must stay in agreement.

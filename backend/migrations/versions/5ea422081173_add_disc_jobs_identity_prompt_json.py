"""add disc_jobs.identity_prompt_json

Non-blocking identity CTA for jobs that rip first and ask questions later
(walk-away Phase B). Stores a JSON envelope {"kind": "name"|"season"|"reidentify",
"reason": "<human-readable text>"} set by IdentificationCoordinator when a disc
ships to RIPPING with an open identity question. Cleared when the user answers
(Phase B5) or converted to review_reason at rip-end if blocking review is still
needed (Phase B4). Nullable — absence means no pending prompt.

Frozen builds skip Alembic entirely and converge via database.py::_add_missing_columns(),
which honours nullable → DEFAULT NULL — the two paths must stay in agreement.

# smoke_test_frozen.sh - boot a PyInstaller-built engram bundle and assert it works.
#
# Shared by release.yml (every non-Windows build job) and ci.yml's frozen-build
# gate, so PR-time and release-time smoke assertions cannot drift apart. The
# Windows job keeps its own PowerShell translation of this logic.
#
# Why this exists at all: `pyinstaller` exiting 0 proves nothing about the
# bundle. Unresolved dynamic imports are reported as non-fatal WARNINGs, so a
# dependency bump can produce a green build whose binary dies on startup. Three
# releases (v0.29.0 - v0.31.0) shipped that way. Only booting the thing catches it.
#
# Usage:
#   backend/scripts/smoke_test_frozen.sh <exe-path> [--expect-lan-access]
#
# Options:
#   --expect-lan-access  additionally assert the build seeded allow_lan_access=True
#                        (the headless server variants).
#
# Environment:
#   PORT  port the executable listens on (default 8765). The caller exports this
#         to the executable too, so both sides must agree.
#
# Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 smoke failure, 2 usage error.

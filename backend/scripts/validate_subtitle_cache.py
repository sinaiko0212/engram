"""Validate that a downloaded subtitle-cache release matches current main.

Invoked by .github/workflows/subtitle-cache-smoke.yml against the daily-uploaded
`subtitle-cache-latest` release. Checks:

1. sha256 of the tarball matches the value in the sibling manifest.json
2. cache_format_version in manifest matches CACHE_FORMAT_VERSION
3. vectorizer_config_hash in manifest matches vectorizer_config_hash()
4. n_features in manifest matches HASHING_N_FEATURES
5. Tarball untars cleanly and contains required entries
6. shows dict is non-empty (catches smoke-build-uploaded-by-mistake)

Exits 0 on success, 1 on any validation failure (with all failures listed).

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/validate_subtitle_cache.py /path/to/release/assets

The given directory must contain both `engram-subtitle-cache.tar.gz` and
`manifest.json`. Designed to be importable too so the validation logic itself
is unit-testable (see tests/unit/test_validate_subtitle_cache.py).

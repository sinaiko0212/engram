"""Build the precomputed subtitle-vector cache shipped with Engram.

Harvests subtitles for the most-voted TV shows on TMDB, reduces each episode to a
HASHED TF-IDF vector (no readable vocabulary -- see app/matcher/vectorizer_config),
discards the raw SRT, and packages the vectors into a `.tar.gz` plus a manifest
for hosting on GitHub Releases.

Usage (from backend/):
    uv run python scripts/build_subtitle_cache.py --limit 300
    uv run python scripts/build_subtitle_cache.py --shows "The Expanse,Arrested Development"
    uv run python scripts/build_subtitle_cache.py --show-list scripts/curated_shows.csv

TMDB / OpenSubtitles credentials are read from the AppConfig DB row; in CI they
are bootstrapped from the env vars TMDB_API_KEY, OPENSUBTITLES_API_KEY,
OPENSUBTITLES_USERNAME, OPENSUBTITLES_PASSWORD.

EXIT CODES -- a publishing wrapper MUST branch on these:

    0  Success. The run finished the whole selected corpus. The tarball is
       complete and is safe to publish.
    1  Failure. Nothing usable was produced (no TMDB key, or no subtitles
       harvested at all). No tarball worth publishing exists.
    2  HALTED ON QUOTA. The OpenSubtitles budget/floor guard stopped the run
       partway through. A tarball MAY still have been written, but it contains
       ONLY the shows completed before the halt.

       **An exit-2 artifact is PARTIAL and MUST NOT be published.** A nightly
       `gh release upload --clobber` that ignores the exit code would replace
       the full published cache with a truncated one after a single
       quota-capped night, and every Engram install would silently pick up the
       smaller cache. Re-run after the daily quota resets instead; the harvest
       resumes from disk.

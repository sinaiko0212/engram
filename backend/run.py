"""Engram entry point for PyInstaller frozen builds.

Wraps the entire import and startup sequence in error handling so that
any crash — including module-level import errors — keeps the console
window open with a visible traceback.

The startup runs under an ``if __name__ == "__main__"`` guard with
``multiprocessing.freeze_support()`` called first. In a frozen build the
multiprocessing ``spawn`` start method (the default on macOS and Windows)
relaunches *this same executable* for every worker process. Without the
guard each relaunch would re-run the whole startup — re-binding the port,
re-opening the browser, and spawning yet more workers — a fork-bomb that
opens an endless stream of browser tabs until the machine gives out.
``freeze_support()`` intercepts those relaunches and exits before reaching
``main()``.

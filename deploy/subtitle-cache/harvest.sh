# Nightly subtitle-cache harvest for the Engram server deployment.
#
# Sequence: lock -> preflight -> harvest -> pack from disk -> shrink guard ->
# publish with retries -> verify the published assets.
#
# WHY PACK SEPARATELY INSTEAD OF PUBLISHING THE BUILD SCRIPT'S TARBALL:
# build_subtitle_cache.py exits 2 when the OpenSubtitles budget guard halts it
# partway, and its tarball then holds ONLY the shows completed before the halt.
# Publishing that would truncate the live cache after a single quota-capped
# night. pack_subtitle_cache.py instead walks everything already on disk and
# downloads nothing, so its artifact is complete on every night -- including
# nights the harvest halted early. The harvest exit code is still reported and
# still decides whether the run is called healthy.
#
# EXIT CODES (the systemd unit must distinguish them):
#   0   published; the harvest completed the full corpus
#   10  published successfully, but the harvest halted on quota. With
#       ENGRAM_MAX_DOWNLOADS well under the account's daily cap this is the
#       NORMAL nightly result, not a failure. The accompanying systemd service
#       unit is expected to carry `SuccessExitStatus=10` so a healthy
#       quota-halted night does not show up as a failed unit and train the
#       operator to ignore real failures.
#   20  the shrink guard blocked the upload; the live release is unchanged
#   21  the shrink guard could not decide; nothing was published
#   1   anything else: preflight failure, missing backend, lock held, harvest
#       failure, pack failure, or an upload/verification failure
#   143 terminated by SIGTERM (systemd TimeoutStartSec, or a manual stop)
